# Hey there! 👋 I'm Yomna Hisham

Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm a Computer Engineer passionate about creating innovative solutions and beautiful digital experiences. This is where I showcase my journey, projects, and skills.

## What's Inside? 🚀

I've built this portfolio to be:
- Super responsive (works great on your phone, tablet, or laptop!)
- Clean and modern (because who doesn't love a good-looking website?)
- Interactive (with some cool animations to keep things interesting)
- Easy to navigate (finding stuff should be simple, right?)

## Cool Features I Added ✨

- **Smooth Navigation**: No more clunky menus! Everything slides smoothly into place
- **Project Showcase**: Check out my work, filtered by what interests you most
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover over things - you'll see some neat effects!
- **Contact Form**: Want to chat? Drop me a message!
- **Responsive Design**: Looks awesome no matter what device you're using

## Tech Stack I Used 🛠️

- HTML5 (for structure)
- CSS3 (for style - with some cool variables for easy theming)
- JavaScript (vanilla, no frameworks - keeping it simple!)
- Font Awesome (for those cute icons)
- Google Fonts (because typography matters!)
